# Randomly generates a grid with 0s and 1s, whose dimension is controlled by user input,
# as well as the density of 1s in the grid, and determines the size of the largest
# isosceles triangle, consisting of nothing but 1s and whose base can be either
# vertical or horizontal, pointing either left or right or up or down.
