# Randomly fills a grid with True and False, with width, height and density
# controlled by user input, and computes the number of all "good paths" that link
# a point of coordinates (x1, y1) to a point of coordinates (x2, y2)
# (x1 and x2 are horizontal coordinates, increasing from left to right,
# y1 and y2 are vertical coordinates, increasing from top to bottom,
# both starting from 0), that is:
# - paths that go through nothing but True values in the grid
# - paths that never go through a given point in the grid more than once;
# - paths that never keep the same direction (North, South, East, West) over
#   a distance greater than 2.
